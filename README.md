# **LAN Chat Application**

## 📡 Overview

The **LAN Chat Application** is a real-time messaging system built for seamless communication between users connected on the same Local Area Network (LAN). It is designed to work without internet access, making it a lightweight and secure alternative for internal communication in environments like schools, offices, and local teams.

## 🚀 Features

* Real-time text-based chat
* Peer-to-peer or client-server communication (based on implementation)
* Multi-user support via multithreading
* User login using usernames or IP addresses
* Join/leave notifications
* Simple, user-friendly interface (CLI or GUI)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python / Java / C# (choose your stack)
* **Concepts:** Socket Programming, TCP/IP Protocols, Multithreading
* **Optional GUI:** Tkinter / JavaFX / Windows Forms

## 🛠️ How It Works

The application uses socket connections over a local network. In a client-server model, the server listens for incoming client connections and handles message distribution. Clients connect to the server, send messages, and receive broadcasted messages in real time. Multithreading ensures that multiple users can interact concurrently without blocking the system.

## 💡 Use Cases

* Internal communication in computer labs or classrooms
* Chat system for office teams without internet dependency
* Learning tool for networking and socket programming

## 📈 Future Improvements

* File sharing
* Message encryption
* Chat history and logging
* Enhanced UI/UX

## 📌 Note

This project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate core concepts in networking and real-time communication systems.
